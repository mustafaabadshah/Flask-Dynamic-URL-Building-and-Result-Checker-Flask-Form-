# Flask Dynamic URL Building and Result Checker

This Flask application demonstrates how to build URLs dynamically using variable rules and handle form submissions to process user input. The application evaluates a user's score based on inputs for different subjects and returns a result of "Pass" or "Fail" depending on the calculated average score.

## Features

- **Dynamic URL Building**: Use of Flask’s `url_for` to dynamically generate URLs based on function names and variable rules.
- **HTTP Methods**: The application supports both GET and POST methods to handle form submissions.
- **Form Handling**: Collects user input through an HTML form and processes the data server-side.
- **Result Calculation**: Calculates the average score of the user based on inputs from different subjects and displays whether the user has passed or failed.
- **Templates**: Utilizes Jinja2 templates to render HTML pages dynamically.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-result-checker.git
   cd flask-result-checker
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

```

## How It Works

- **`app.py`**: This is the main file that runs the Flask application. It defines routes for different URLs and handles the logic for calculating and displaying results.
- **Templates**: The `index.html` file contains the form where users input their scores. The `result.html` file displays the final result after processing the form submission.

### Routes:

- **`/`**: The home page displaying the form.
- **`/submit`**: Handles the form submission and calculates the result.
- **`/success/<int:score>`**: Displays the success message for passing scores.
- **`/fail/<int:score>`**: Displays the failure message for failing scores.
- **`/results/<int:score>`**: Redirects based on the score to either the success or fail page.

## Usage

1. Go to the home page and fill out the form with scores for Science, Maths, C, and Data Science.
2. Upon submitting the form, the application will calculate the average score.
3. The user will be redirected to a result page displaying either "Pass" or "Fail" based on their average score.
